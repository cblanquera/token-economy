# Token Economy

This is a dated token launcher with sale, vesting and treasury 
all on chain. It was used to prove that all 
**offline token sales are scams** and consumers should only consider 
tokens where the utility including sale was managed on-chain to prove 
whatever they are claiming.

This also partially addresses security tokens and *"promise of returns"*
in that no matter what happens, the consumer can see their vestments and
how the funds in the treasury are used.

Other considerations include:

 - DAO to automatically execute token contract functions
 - Token contract can open/close access to/from other contracts
 - Treasury can open/close access to/from other contracts
 - Vestors direct access to tokens but no ability to trade flag
 - AMM token swap
